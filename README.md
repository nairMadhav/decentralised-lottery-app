# Decentralised Forum with integrated Lottery using Solidity and React

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Smart Contract on Ethereum using Alchemy. 
The smart contract was compiled using HardHat and is deployed on Rinkeby.

[Hosted on Replit here](https://hellomadhav.madhavnair6.repl.co "Hello Madhav!")

#### The Forum has a 10% chance of awarding the user a rETH based incentive.
> The client was built on React and uses web3.js to communicate with the Ethereum object on the browser.
> The frontend uses Vite as a build tool to ease the development process

## Run the program on localhost using 
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
```
## Deploy your contract using Hardhat with the following command
```shell
 npx hardhat run scripts/deployer.js --network rinkeby
 ```
